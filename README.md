# Portfolio Website - Kyle Wick

## General Info

After a much needed redesign, the project much more closely matches what I originally set out to build: A fun little portfolio website built with the essentials, with my own twist added to the mix. The most current update to the site (the complete website overhaul) took me about 5 days in total of part time work, totalling to roughly 20 hours.

### Challenges
One of the hardest things to get a handle on was learning Git and implementing a workflow that works for me. My commits could use some work, but I am content with how the project handled.

### What I Learned
I was able to become more aquainted with Git and its interface, and learned common branching strategies. This project also forced me to look into areas of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I've never heard of before, which was a huge eye-opener.
